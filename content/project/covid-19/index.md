## Introduction

We model the spread of COVID-19 infection in Texas using PDE based SEIRD model. The model describes spatially changing susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and a deceased fraction of the population. The model is discretized using finite element approximation and an implicit Euler scheme. At each time step, we perform fixed-point iteration to solve the coupled equations; see paper for more details. The solver is implemented using [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/).

To infer for the model parameters and to check the validity of the model, we employ the Bayesian inference in OPAL (Occam Plausibility Algorithm), see [Oden et al. 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119176817.ecm2101) and [Oden 2018](https://doi.org/10.1017/S096249291800003X). The model parameters are inferred using the total number of infected and deceased cases in Texas. The results show that the model is invalid for predicting the infected patients and is *Not Invalid* to predict the deceased cases.

For Bayesian inference, [hIPPYlib](https://hippylib.github.io/) library is used. The preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) algorithm in hIPPYlib is utilized for generating posterior samples.

## Results

### Validation results
The model was found to be invalid for predicting the total infected cases; however, it is found to be adequate for the prediction of the total deceased cases. 

### Prediction results

- By September 1, 2020, we predict to see about **7003** fatalities and **301658** infected cases. Uncertainties, in terms of the standard deviation of the QoI distribution, in deceased and infected cases are about **102** and **5786**. 

> These calculations are based on the COVID-19 data up to June 30, 2020. It is now clear that the model has underestimated the deceased cases even though it was valid. This motivates us to look further into the model. It is also possible that the upward trend of deceased cases was not strong in the data.
