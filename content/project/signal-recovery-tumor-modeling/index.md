Developement of models of tumor growth, angiogenesis, and drug therapy and recovery of model parameters from the imaging data

# Activity

## A mechanistic tumor growth model for HP MRI

Objective of this project is to propose a PDE based model for recovery of signals from the HP MR imaging data. At present, ODE based compartmental models are considered.

Recently, Oden Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and TACC signed an MOU to advance the cancer research. This project was selected as one of the 5 pilot projects under the joint initiative and will be effective from 09/01/2020 - 08/31/2021.
