Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral scholar at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests include computational modeling, fracture mechanics, computational oncology, Bayesian model inference, and neural network. Much of my work is in collaboration with people at Louisiana State University, Technical University of Munich, and MD Anderson Cancer Center. I received a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in August 2016. I then worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Department of Mathematics, Louisiana State University. In August 2019, I moved to the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences as a Peter O'Donnell Postdoctoral Scholar and work with Dr. J. Tinsley Oden. At UT Austin, I am involved in the projects related to modeling of tumor growth and block-copolymers. I am also continuing to work on Peridynamics and its application to brittle fracture in solids. 

Current work includes developing new models of tumor growth and calibration-validation of the models. Of particular interest is the angiogenesis in the tumor growth where new blood vessels are formed (and destroyed) in response to various signals from the nutrient-starved tumor cells. The model in development consists of a 1D network of blood vessels embedded in the tissue domain. The flow in the vessel is coupled with the flow in the tissue. The network of vessels is dynamic and can grow based on the signals from nearby tumor cores. This work is done in collaboration with researchers at the Technical University of Munich. Related to tumor modeling, the work also includes the application of a physics-informed neural network. I am also involved in modeling phase separation in block-copolymers using the Cahn-Hilliard equation. This work is done in collaboration with the [AEOLUS](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/about/news/527/) group at UT Austin.

Work also includes analysis of Peridynamics and its application to the fracture in solids. Recently, we have shown that the energy balance, similar to Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics, can be obtained for crack propagation governed by Peridynamics formulation. This work is in collaboration with Dr. Robert Lipton at Louisiana State University. With Patrick Diehl at LSU, we have developed a C++ code based on the HPX library and currently working on its parallelization. We have a project in Google Summer of Code related to this, see [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?fbclid=IwAR20LX6DS97pzzRxBKFZiRR4vePMETYqTUPPBkrS-IfEcWha6MbVlbkNfh0#6693763189047296) and also code development on [Github](https://github.com/nonlocalmodels/nonlocalheatequation).
