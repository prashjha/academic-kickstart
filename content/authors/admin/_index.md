Prashant K. Jha is a postdoctoral scholar in Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. His research interests include computational modeling, continuum and fracture mechanics, modeling of tumor, Bayesian model inference, and neural network. He collaborates with people at universities such as Louisiana State University, Rice University, Technical University of Munich, and organization such as MD Anderson Cancer Center. 

Current work involves proposing tumor growth models and their calibration and validation using predictive modeling framework. We are also interested in modeling phase separation in block-copolymers using Cahn-Hilliard equation. This will be done in collaboration with the researchers in [AEOLUS](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/about/news/527/) project at UT Austin.
